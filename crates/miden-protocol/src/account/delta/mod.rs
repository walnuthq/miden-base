    /// ## Computation
    ///
    /// The delta is a sequential hash over a vector of field elements which starts out empty and
    /// is appended to in the following way. Whenever sorting is expected, it is that of a
    /// [`LexicographicWord`](crate::LexicographicWord). The WORD layout is in memory-order.
    ///
    /// - Append `[[nonce_delta, 0, account_id_suffix, account_id_prefix], EMPTY_WORD]`, where
    ///   account_id_{prefix,suffix} are the prefix and suffix felts of the native account id and
    ///   nonce_delta is the value by which the nonce was incremented.
    /// - Fungible Asset Delta
    ///   - For each **updated** fungible asset, sorted by its vault key, whose amount delta is
    ///     **non-zero**:
    ///     - Append `[domain = 1, was_added, 0, 0]`.
    ///     - Append `[amount, 0, faucet_id_suffix, faucet_id_prefix]` where amount is the delta by
    ///       which the fungible asset's amount has changed and was_added is a boolean flag
    ///       indicating whether the amount was added (1) or subtracted (0).
    /// - Non-Fungible Asset Delta
    ///   - For each **updated** non-fungible asset, sorted by its vault key:
    ///     - Append `[domain = 1, was_added, 0, 0]` where was_added is a boolean flag indicating
    ///       whether the asset was added (1) or removed (0). Note that the domain is the same for
    ///       assets since `faucet_id_prefix` is at the same position in the layout for both assets,
    ///       and, by design, it is never the same for fungible and non-fungible assets.
    ///     - Append `[hash0, hash1, hash2, faucet_id_prefix]`, i.e. the non-fungible asset.
    /// - Storage Slots are sorted by slot ID and are iterated in this order. For each slot **whose
    ///   value has changed**, depending on the slot type:
    ///   - Value Slot
    ///     - Append `[[domain = 2, 0, slot_id_suffix, slot_id_prefix], NEW_VALUE]` where
    ///       `NEW_VALUE` is the new value of the slot and `slot_id_{suffix, prefix}` is the
    ///       identifier of the slot.
    ///   - Map Slot
    ///     - For each key-value pair, sorted by key, whose new value is different from the previous
    ///       value in the map:
    ///       - Append `[KEY, NEW_VALUE]`.
    ///     - Append `[[domain = 3, num_changed_entries, slot_id_suffix, slot_id_prefix], 0, 0, 0,
    ///       0]`, where `slot_id_{suffix, prefix}` are the slot identifiers and
    ///       `num_changed_entries` is the number of changed key-value pairs in the map.
    ///         - For partial state deltas, the map header must only be included if
    ///           `num_changed_entries` is not zero.
    ///         - For full state deltas, the map header must always be included.
    ///
    /// ## Rationale
    ///
    /// The rationale for this layout is that hashing in the VM should be as efficient as possible
    /// and minimize the number of branches to be as efficient as possible. Every high-level section
    /// in this bullet point list should add an even number of words since the hasher operates
    /// on double words. In the VM, each permutation is done immediately, so adding an uneven
    /// number of words in a given step will result in more difficulty in the MASM implementation.
    ///
    /// ### New Accounts
    ///
    /// The delta for new accounts (a full state delta) must commit to all the storage slots of the
    /// account, even if the storage slots have a default value (e.g. the empty word for value slots
    /// or an empty storage map). This ensures the full state delta commits to the exact storage
    /// slots that are contained in the account.
    ///
    /// ## Security
    ///
    /// The general concern with the commitment is that two distinct deltas must never hash to the
    /// same commitment. E.g. a commitment of a delta that changes a key-value pair in a storage
    /// map slot should be different from a delta that adds a non-fungible asset to the vault.
    /// If not, a delta can be crafted in the VM that sets a map key but a malicious actor
    /// crafts a delta outside the VM that adds a non-fungible asset. To prevent that, a couple
    /// of measures are taken.
    ///
    /// - Because multiple unrelated contexts (e.g. vaults and storage slots) are hashed in the same
    ///   hasher, domain separators are used to disambiguate. For each changed asset and each
    ///   changed slot in the delta, a domain separator is hashed into the delta. The domain
    ///   separator is always at the same index in each layout so it cannot be maliciously crafted
    ///   (see below for an example).
    /// - Storage value slots:
    ///   - since only changed value slots are included in the delta, there is no ambiguity between
    ///     a value slot being set to EMPTY_WORD and its value being unchanged.
    /// - Storage map slots:
    ///   - Map slots append a header which summarizes the changes in the slot, in particular the
    ///     slot ID and number of changed entries.
    ///   - Two distinct storage map slots use the same domain but are disambiguated due to
    ///     inclusion of the slot ID.
    ///
    /// ### Domain Separators
    ///
    /// As an example for ambiguity, consider these two deltas:
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// [
    ///   ID_AND_NONCE, EMPTY_WORD,
    ///   [/* no fungible asset delta */],
    ///   [[domain = 1, was_added = 0, 0, 0], NON_FUNGIBLE_ASSET],
    ///   [/* no storage delta */]
    /// ]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// [
    ///   ID_AND_NONCE, EMPTY_WORD,
    ///   [/* no fungible asset delta */],
    ///   [/* no non-fungible asset delta */],
    ///   [[domain = 2, 0, slot_id_suffix = 0, slot_id_prefix = 0], NEW_VALUE]
    /// ]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// `NEW_VALUE` is user-controllable so it can be crafted to match `NON_FUNGIBLE_ASSET`. The
    /// domain separator is then the only value that differentiates these two deltas. This shows the
    /// importance of placing the domain separators in the same index within each word's layout
    /// which makes it easy to see that this value cannot be crafted to be the same.
    ///
    /// ### Number of Changed Entries
    ///
    /// As an example for ambiguity, consider these two deltas:
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// [
    ///   ID_AND_NONCE, EMPTY_WORD,
    ///   [/* no fungible asset delta */],
    ///   [/* no non-fungible asset delta */],
    ///   [domain = 3, num_changed_entries = 0, slot_id_suffix = 20, slot_id_prefix = 21, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ///   [domain = 3, num_changed_entries = 0, slot_id_suffix = 42, slot_id_prefix = 43, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    /// ]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// [
    ///   ID_AND_NONCE, EMPTY_WORD,
    ///   [/* no fungible asset delta */],
    ///   [/* no non-fungible asset delta */],
    ///   [KEY0, VALUE0],
    ///   [domain = 3, num_changed_entries = 1, slot_id_suffix = 42, slot_id_prefix = 43, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    /// ]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The keys and values of map slots are user-controllable so `KEY0` and `VALUE0` could be
    /// crafted to match the first map header in the first delta. So, _without_ having
    /// `num_changed_entries` included in the commitment, these deltas would be ambiguous. A delta
    /// with two empty maps could have the same commitment as a delta with one map entry where one
    /// key-value pair has changed.
    ///
    /// #### New Accounts
    ///
    /// The number of changed entries of a storage map can be validly zero when an empty storage map
    /// is added to a new account. In such cases, the number of changed key-value pairs is 0, but
