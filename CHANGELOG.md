# Changelog

## v0.17.0 (TBD)

### Features

- Added `active_note::get_storage_info` and `active_note::get_bounded_storage`, and switched the standard and agglayer note scripts with a bounded storage layout over to the latter ([#3563](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3563)).

### Changes

- Moved the transaction kernel API procedures into the kernel's `api` submodule, leaving `exec_kernel_proc` as the only `syscall`-invocable kernel procedure ([#3646](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3646)).
- [BREAKING] Added the `miden::standards::expiration` MASM module with `apply_default` and used it to apply a default 20-block transaction expiration limit to the standard allowlist and blocklist transfer policies and the fee manager's `estimate_note_fee` procedure ([#3512](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3512)).
- [BREAKING] Moved the internal shared helpers of `miden::protocol::input_note`, `miden::protocol::active_note`, and the note memory-write helpers into private `input_note_internal` and `note_internal` modules ([#3501](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3501)).
- [BREAKING] Sorted the procedures of `AccountCode` after the authentication procedure at index 0, making the account code commitment independent of the order in which components are provided ([#2961](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2961)).
- The transaction kernel now validates that a new account's procedures are sorted and unique ([#3567](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3567)).
- [BREAKING] Changed asset callbacks into validation-only interfaces that return no asset value; the transaction kernel retains and uses the original value, preventing callbacks from modifying it. The kernel commitment changes ([#3505](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3505), [#3513](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3513)).
- [BREAKING] Extracted the shared `MastForestScript` type and `MastForestScriptError` backing `NoteScript` / `TransactionScript`, moving `TransactionScript` into `transaction::script` ([#3516](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3516)).
- Documented the RBAC freeze-only actor pattern on `Authority` and added test coverage pinning that a `FREEZER` can trip the emergency switch but can never unfreeze the account ([#3520](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3520)).
- [BREAKING] `NoteScript::from_parts` and `TransactionScript::from_parts` now return a `Result` instead of panicking when the specified entrypoint is not in the provided MAST forest ([#3548](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3548)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed the fungible asset amount extraction procedures so the unsuffixed name is the validating one ([#3576](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3576)):
  - `miden::protocol::asset::fungible_value_into_amount` -> `fungible_value_into_amount_unchecked`.
  - `miden::standards::assets::fungible_asset::value_into_amount` to `value_into_amount_unchecked`.
  - `to_amount` to `to_amount_unchecked`.
  - `try_value_to_amount` to `value_into_amount`.
- [BREAKING] AggLayer bridge and faucet account builders now take a concrete `BasicConstantFeePolicy` and fee faucet ID, constructing their `FeePolicyManager` internally ([#3583](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3583)).
- [BREAKING] Refactored `AccountVaultDelta` to track generic assets. `FungibleAssetDelta`, `NonFungibleAssetDelta` and `NonFungibleDeltaAction` were removed ([3485](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3485)).
- [BREAKING] The transaction kernel no longer requires assets with `AssetComposition::None` to have the non-fungible asset layout ([#3624](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3624)).
- [BREAKING] Refactored `Asset` into a struct holding `AssetId` and `AssetValue` ([#3625](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3625)).

### Fixes

- [BREAKING] Bound the non-fungible MINT note to its faucet the same way the fungible one is bound: the note now stores the full asset and `non_fungible::mint_and_send` asserts the stored `ASSET_ID` against the asset it derives for the active faucet, unifying the two MINT note storage layouts and collapsing `MintNoteStorage` to `Private` / `Public` ([#3482](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3482)).
- Fixed the multisig, guarded, non-fungible, and AggLayer faucet factories not enabling asset callbacks for faucets configured with a transfer policy ([#3547](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3547)).
- Documented that `authority::assert_authorized` is a no-op under `Authority::AuthControlled` ([#3500](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3500)).
- Fixed `FungibleFaucet::receive_and_burn` treating a non-fungible asset issued by the same account as a fungible burn, which reduced `token_supply` without burning any fungible supply; the asset is now validated with the new `miden::standards::assets::fungible_asset::validate` procedure ([#3553](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3553)).
- Fixed the authentication procedure not ending up at index 0 of an account's code when its MAST root was already exported by another component ([#3566](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3566)).
- [BREAKING] Foreign procedure invocation now requires the provided procedure root to be part of the foreign account's code, so a caller can no longer execute arbitrary code under a foreign account's identity ([#3575](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3575)).
- Verified each input note's storage-item count and preimage against its authenticated storage commitment ([#3593](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3593)).
- Fixed `PrivateOutputNote` construction and deserialization accepting attachment data that is not committed by the note header ([#3556](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3579)).
- Fixed `input_note::remove_asset` leaving a dangling asset slot when a non-canonical fungible value produced an empty removal remainder ([#3591](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3606)).
- Fixed `input_note::remove_asset` succeeding when asked to remove an empty or malformed asset ID instead of reporting the asset as not found ([#3592](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3607)).
- Faucet asset-callback procedure roots are now verified against the faucet's account code before dispatch, so a misconfigured callback root can no longer make an asset nontransferable ([#3612](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3612)).
- [BREAKING] Enforced the limit of 1024 per asset delta op for added and removed account vault deltas inside and outside the tx kernel ([#3623](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3623)).
- Fixed `AccountSchemaCommitment`'s `get_schema_commitment` returning above the 16-element stack depth ([#3645](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3645)).
- Fixed failed assertions raised by deserialized account code or scripts being reported with only their error code instead of their error message.

## v0.16.0 (2026-08-17)

### Features

- Added a genesis-only native fungible faucet factory that configures the faucet to pay fees in its own asset ([#3584](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3584)).
- Added `note_costs` to the `NetworkNotePricer` builder, a supplied cost map that extends or shadows the built-in cost tables ([#3602](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3602)).
- [BREAKING] AggLayer bridge and faucet accounts deploy with a priced fee policy and `ADMIN`-gated repricing; both code commitments change ([#3486](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3486)).
- [BREAKING] The AggLayer bridge now accepts `RbacConfigNote`s, enabling on-chain rotation of its `ADMIN`, `FAUCET_MNGR`, `GER_INJECTOR`, and `GER_REMOVER` roles; the `create_existing_bridge_account_with_roles` testing fixture now takes the `ADMIN` member explicitly ([#2706](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2706)).
- Added the `ConstantFeeManager` account component, exposing the authority-gated `set_note_fee` procedure to update a `BasicConstantFeePolicy`'s fee schedule on a network account after deployment; the supplied fee asset's ID is validated against the account's configured fee asset and its value word is validated to be a well-formed fungible amount not exceeding the maximum ([#3322](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3322)).
- Added the `miden-protocol-build-utils` crate with helpers to assemble MASM code ([#3334](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3334)).
- Added `<NOTE>_CONSUMPTION_CYCLES` constants in `miden_standards::note::costs` and `miden_agglayer::costs`, exposing each standard/agglayer note's benchmarked consumption cost for the canonical network-account transaction, regenerated via `make update-note-costs` and guarded by CI snapshot tests with a 5% drift tolerance ([#3354](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3354)).
- [BREAKING] Added `NetworkNotePricer` in `miden-tx` (with the `NoteConsumptionCost` trait and the `StandardNote::note_cost` / `AgglayerNote::note_cost` lookups) to turn the benchmarked note consumption costs into network account fee schedules via `BasicConstantFeePolicy::with_fees`; `TransactionFee` moved from miden-protocol's testing module to the public API (now fallibly constructed from the total cycle count, mirroring the kernel fee formula exactly) with the pricer building on it, and the now-unused `TransactionMeasurements::trace_length` was removed ([#3356](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3356)).
- Added `miden::standards::interop::eth::bytes32_to_account_id` and the `TryFrom<[u8; 32]>` impl for `EthAddress` for converting bytes32-embedded Ethereum-format addresses ([#3426](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3426)).
- Added the `BlocklistConfigNote` standard note, which dispatches the `BlocklistManager` admin procedures (`block_account`, `unblock_account`) on the account that consumes it ([#3438](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3438)).
- Added the `AllowlistConfigNote` standard note, which dispatches the `AllowlistManager` admin procedures (`allow_account`, `disallow_account`) on the account that consumes it ([#3440](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3440)).
- Added test coverage for the `FungibleFaucet` metadata string setters (`set_description`, `set_logo_uri`, `set_external_link`) ([#3450](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3450)).
- Added the `FaucetMetadataConfigNote` standard note, which dispatches the `FungibleFaucet` token metadata setters (`set_max_supply`, `set_description`, `set_logo_uri`, `set_external_link`) on the account that consumes it ([#3453](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3453)).
- [BREAKING] Added the `SponsorshipPolicy` setting to `AuthNetworkAccount` to configure whether a transaction is allowed to fund outgoing sponsorship notes from the account's vault or if all fees must come from input sponsorship notes. ([#3456](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3456)).
- [BREAKING] Cached each input note's `NoteId` in the transaction prologue and added the `miden::protocol::input_note::get_note_id` and `miden::protocol::active_note::get_note_id` accessors. The input note memory layout and the kernel procedure offsets shift, so the kernel commitment changes ([#3291](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3291)).
- Added the standardized `ConstantFeePolicyConfigNote`, which schedules a fee for a note script root by calling a consuming network account's `ConstantFeeManager::set_note_fee`, and registered it as `StandardNote::CONSTANT_FEE_POLICY_CONFIG` ([#3322](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3322)).
- Extended the standardized `NetworkAccountConfig` note with `AddAllowedFeePolicy` / `RemoveAllowedFeePolicy` actions, letting a network account manage its allowed fee policy roots post-deployment via the authority-gated `add_allowed_fee_policy` / `remove_allowed_fee_policy` procedures ([#3325](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3325)).
- [BREAKING] Added an emergency pause to the AggLayer bridge via the standards `Pausable`/`PausableManager` components: all bridge entry points except `remove_ger` abort while paused, and the `ADMIN`-gated standards `PAUSE_CONFIG` note toggles the state; the bridge code commitment and note allowlist change ([#2696](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2696)).
- Added the `MinBurnAmountConfigNote` standard note ([#3511](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3511)).
- Exposed AggLayer bridge storage readers such as `is_ger_registered`, `network_id`, and `cgi_chain_hash` outside the `testing` feature ([#3617](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3617)).

### Changes

- [BREAKING] Moved the `note_tag` MASM module from `miden::standards::note_tag` to `miden::standards::note::note_tag` ([#3310](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3310)).
- [BREAKING] Moved the `note_creator` account component MASM namespace from `miden::standards::components::wallets::note_creator` to `miden::standards::components::note::note_creator`, and moved the Rust `NoteCreator` type from `account::wallets` to `account::note_creator` ([#3310](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3310)).
- [BREAKING] Bind the standard config notes to their target account: `OwnerConfigNote`, `PauseConfigNote`, `RbacConfigNote`, `FaucetPolicyConfigNote`, `AllowlistConfigNote`, `BlocklistConfigNote` and `FaucetMetadataConfigNote` now carry a `NetworkAccountTarget` attachment for that account ([#3433](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3433), [#3455](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3455)).
- [BREAKING] BURN notes now store and validate the asset passed to `receive_and_burn`, and target its faucet with a `NetworkAccountTarget` attachment ([#2343](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2343)).
- [BREAKING] Moved the generic EVM-bridging helpers from `miden-agglayer` into `miden-standards`: the `agglayer::common` MASM modules now live at `miden::standards::utils`, `miden::standards::assets::conversion` and `miden::standards::interop::eth`. Corresponding Rust types moved to `miden_standards::interop::eth` ([#3423](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3423)).
- [BREAKING] Reduced the maximum number of assets a note can carry from 64 to 16 ([#3381](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3381)).
- Added a new `INPUT_NOTE_INDEX_LOOKUP_EVENT` that lets transaction hosts provide an input-note index hint. Successful lookups authenticate it against the `NoteId` cached by the transaction prologue, while reported misses are validated by a full scan ([#3424](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3424)).
- [BREAKING] Transaction summaries now bind the reference block, expiration delta, and seven user parameters; the Rust and MASM APIs changed accordingly ([#3210](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3210)).
- Moved account-patch commitment validation from `AccountUpdateDetails::validate()` into `TxAccountUpdate::new()` and consolidated all `ProvenTransaction` invariant checks in `from_parts()`, fixing a deserialization bypass of the circular-note check ([#3412](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3412)).
- [BREAKING] Unified the two account-origin authenticators in the transaction kernel's `api.masm` into a single `authenticate_account_origin` procedure that conditionally tracks the call ([#3310](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3310)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `TransactionContext` to `MockTransaction` and `TxContextInput` to `MockTransactionInput` in `miden-testing`, and migrated the transaction tests to `MockChain::build_transaction` ([#3313](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3313)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `AccountBuilder::with_auth_component`; the authentication component is now passed like any other component via `with_component` or `with_components` ([#3379](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3379)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed the remaining "library" APIs to use "package" terminology: `NoteScript::from_library` / `from_library_reference` and `TransactionScript::from_library` / `from_library_reference` are now `from_package` / `from_package_reference`, `TransactionKernel::library` is now `TransactionKernel::core_package`, `agglayer_library` is now `agglayer_package`, and the `CodeBuilder` linking methods and testing helpers follow suit (e.g. `link_static_package` / `link_dynamic_package` / `with_kernel_core_package`, `assemble_test_package`). Also removed the redundant `AccountComponent::from_library` in favor of `from_package` ([#TBD](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3382)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the deprecated `TransactionContextBuilder` and the `MockChain::build_tx_context` / `build_tx_context_at` methods; use `MockChain::build_transaction` instead ([#1919](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/1919)).
- [BREAKING] Made `MockTransaction::execute_code` and the `executor` module test-only, and removed `MockTransactionBuilder::disable_lazy_loading` ([#1919](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/1919)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed the `FeeManager` component to `FeePolicyManager` and turned it from an account component into the fee-policy configuration of the `AuthNetworkAccount` component ([#3353](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3353)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `ConstantFeePolicy` to `BasicConstantFeePolicy` ([#3391](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3391)).
- [BREAKING] Changed `AssetId` serialization to omit the `AssetClass` for `AssetComposition::Fungible` ([#3413](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3413)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced `SwapNote::create` with `SwapNote::builder()` ([#3414](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3414)).
- [BREAKING] Moved the network-account default configuration into `AuthNetworkAccount::new`, which now allowlists the `NetworkAccountConfigNote` and `FeeSponsorshipNote` script roots and the canonical `ExpirationTransactionScript` tx-script root; added `AuthNetworkAccount::custom` to build a raw component with no default configuration for low-level use, and removed `AuthNetworkAccount::with_allowed_tx_scripts` ([#3392](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3392)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the redundant zero-nomination check and the `ERR_NO_NOMINATED_OWNER` error constant from `ownable2step::accept_ownership`; since a note sender can never be the zero address stored when no transfer is nominated, accepting ownership without a pending nomination now fails with `ERR_SENDER_NOT_NOMINATED_OWNER` ([#3416](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3416)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed the component management notes to use "config" terminology: `FaucetPolicyActionNote`, `OwnerActionNote`, `PauseActionNote` and `RbacActionNote` (and the action enums they carry) are now `FaucetPolicyConfigNote`, `OwnerConfigNote`, `PauseConfigNote` and `RbacConfigNote`, and every config note builder takes its action via `.config()` instead of `.action()` ([#3434](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3434)).
- [BREAKING] Made `RbacConfigNote` and `OwnerConfigNote` add the `NetworkAccountTarget` attachment routing the note to the managed account unless the caller supplies one, since both are network notes, and convert into an `AccountTargetNetworkNote` via `From` ([#3434](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3434)).
- Always insert recipients of input notes into the advice map to simplify note fee stimation ([#3421](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3421)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the outdated `AccountId` to `[Felt; 2]` conversion. Use `AccountId::{suffix, prefix}` accessors instead ([#3422](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3422)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the standalone `Warden` account component and the `miden::standards::access::warden` module ([#3436](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3436)).
- [BREAKING] Bound FEE_SPONSORSHIP notes to the notes they pay for by note ID instead of by position in `collect_sponsored_fees` and allow multiple sponsorship notes to sponsor the same feature note ([#3318](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3318)).
- [BREAKING] Changed the `FaucetPolicyActionNote` storage layout from `[selector, POLICY_ROOT]` to `[POLICY_ROOT, selector]` to optimize instruction counts ([#3448](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3448)).
- Added test coverage for the `FungibleFaucet` metadata string setters (`set_description`, `set_logo_uri`, `set_external_link`) ([#3450](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3450)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the `AuthSingleSigAcl` auth component, the `Auth::Acl` `miden-testing` mock-chain variant, and the `user_faucet_single_sig_acl` testing helper: the exempt (no-signature) branch let fee-charging accounts be drained via calls to exempt procedures. The plain `AuthSingleSig` component (every call requires a signature) remains available and now backs the "singlesig user faucet" factories; a `BurnNote` targeted at a singlesig user faucet, previously exempt via `receive_and_burn`, now requires the owner's signature to be consumed ([#3360](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3360)).
- [BREAKING] Updated `miden-vm` dependencies to v0.29. Notable downstream changes: `CoreLibrary` now bundles a separate `miden-precompiles` package that must also be seeded into the package registry (`CoreLibrary::packages()`), the advice stack moved behind the typed `AdviceStack` API on `AdviceInputs`, `Kernel` was renamed to `KernelDescriptor` (with `Package::to_kernel` becoming `to_kernel_descriptor` and `Package::module_infos` becoming `module_descriptors`), and `miden_verifier::verify` now takes an `ExecutionClaim` and verifies bundled precompile proofs itself, replacing `verify_with_precompiles` ([#3492](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3492)).
- Updated `miden-vm` dependencies to v0.29.1, picking up the `PartialSmt::from_unique_nodes()` reconstruction fix, the persistent `LargeSmtForest::entries()` iteration fix, support for Keccak-256 wrapper preimages covering never-written memory, and the new `ecdsa_k256_keccak::verify_bytes` procedure ([#3573](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3573)).
- [BREAKING] `TokenPolicyManager` now dispatches mint and burn policies via `dyncall` rather than `dynexec` ([#3510](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3510)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `miden-standards` component `NAME` constants to mirror their module paths, with `procedure_root!` lookups now using dedicated `*_LIBRARY_PATH` constants ([#3495](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3495)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced `RoleBasedAccessControl::new` with a validating `RoleBasedAccessControl::builder()` over `RoleConfig`s, which seeds each role's members together with its delegated admin, so exclusive delegation is established at account creation instead of through on-chain `set_role_admin` calls ([#3515](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3515)).
- [BREAKING] Updated `NoteScript::from_package` and `TransactionScript::from_package` to reject executable packages with the new `MastForestScriptError::ExecutablePackage`, so scripts are identified only by their `@note_script` / `@transaction_script` attribute ([#3528](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3528)).
- [BREAKING] Updated `AccountComponent::from_package` to take `Package` by value ([#3528](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3528)).

### Fixes

- Fixed `faucet::mint` and `faucet::burn` failing when the asset's witness in the input vault had not already been loaded, which happened when minting into a faucet whose vault held other assets, or when burning an asset the transaction had not otherwise accessed; both procedures now request the witness from the host before updating the input vault ([#3409](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3409)).
- Enforced the canonical encoding of `Authority` role map values on read: `Authority::try_from_storage` now rejects a procedure-role value word whose reserved felts (`value[1..=3]`) are non-zero, matching the value-slot check and completing the fix started in [#3209](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3209) ([#3415](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3415)).
- Fixed `RoleBasedAccessControl` role administration becoming permanently unmanageable when a role's admin was delegated to a memberless role ([#3476](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3476)).
- [BREAKING] The transaction kernel now asserts that asset callbacks return the asset value they received, aborting with `ERR_FAUCET_CALLBACK_ASSET_VALUE_MUST_MATCH_INPUT` otherwise; previously, offsetting callback transformations could redistribute value between outputs while passing the epilogue's aggregate conservation check. The kernel commitment changes ([#3442](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3442)).
- Restricted indexed input-note asset removal to the native account's context while preserving active-note self-removal. As a consequence, note scripts and transaction scripts can no longer remove input-note assets by index directly, and neither can foreign accounts invoked through FPI; indexed removal must go through a procedure of the native account ([#3445](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3445)).
- Fixed the PSWAP note-fill asset to its own payback note ([#3469](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3469)).
- Fixed `CodeInspection`'s `get_code_commitment`, `get_num_procedures` and `get_procedure_root` and the `min_burn_amount` burn policy's `get_min_burn_amount` returning above the 16-element stack depth ([#3470](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3470)).
- [BREAKING] Bounded the length of the encoded signature that the transaction host's `AuthRequest` event handler takes from the advice map, so an entry planted under a signature key can no longer make the host allocate an arbitrary amount of memory ([#3472](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3472)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `Signature::to_prepared_signature` to `Signature::to_encoded_signature` ([#3472](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3472)).
- Clarified the `ERR_BURN_AMOUNT_BELOW_MIN_BURN_AMOUNT` error message to better match the actual validated constraint ([#3474](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3474)).
- Fixed misleading `NonFungibleFaucet` documentation, it is now stated as an off-chain convention([#3484](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3484)).
- Added the missing `Invocation: exec` label to the document comments of the public `miden-standards` MASM procedures([#3503](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3503)).
- Exempted the issuing faucet from its own `BasicBlocklist` / `BasicAllowlist` transfer policy, so a self-entry no longer disables the faucet's minting ([#3508](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3508)).

## v0.16.0-beta.1 (2026-07-20)

### Features

- [BREAKING] Made the AggLayer bridge's network ID a deployment setting: the ID is stored in the `agglayer::bridge::network_id` storage slot (written once at account creation and read at runtime via `bridge_config::load_network_id`) instead of being compiled in as the `MIDEN_NETWORK_ID` MASM constant, so all deployments share one bridge code commitment; `create_bridge_account` now takes a `network_id` argument ([#3062](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3062)).
- Added the `tx::get_fee_faucet_id` kernel accessor, exposing the fee faucet ID from the transaction's reference block to user code ([#2899](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/discussions/2899)).
- Added the `miden::protocol::tx::compute_fee` procedure, which lets account and note code compute the transaction fee during execution ([#3211](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3211)).
- Added the `FeeSponsorshipNote` standard note, which carries the fee for the feature note it is bound to by `NoteId`, along with helpers for computing note IDs on-chain ([#3274](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3274)).
- Added the `UpgradeManager` account component for network account code and storage upgrades ([#3299](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3299)).
- Added the `miden::standards::assets::non_fungible_asset::validate` MASM procedure, which validates a non-fungible asset's composition and the binding of its value to the asset class, and used it in the `NonFungibleFaucet` burn procedure ([#3308](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3308)).
- Added a `FeeManager` account component exposing the FPI-callable `estimate_note_fee` procedure, dispatching the fee computation to a configurable fee policy (first policy: `ConstantFeePolicy`) switchable via the authority-gated `set_fee_policy` ([#3309](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3309), [#3328](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3328)).
- Added the `collect_sponsored_fees` procedure to the `FeeManager`, which walks a transaction's input notes to tally the fees prepaid by their paired `FEE_SPONSORSHIP` notes and credits the aggregated fee to the account's vault ([#3320](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3320)).
- Added the `create_sponsorship_notes` procedure to the `FeeManager` to create sponsorship notes for all created network notes ([#3321](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3321)).
- Integrated fee collection and sponsorship note creation into `AuthNetworkAccount` ([#3351](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3351)).
- Added post-deployment management of `AuthNetworkAccount` allowlists: authority-gated `add_allowed_note_script` / `remove_allowed_note_script` / `add_allowed_tx_script` / `remove_allowed_tx_script` procedures (composed with an `Authority` component in `OwnerControlled` or `RbacControlled` mode), a standardized `NetworkAccountConfigNote` to invoke them, and an `AuthNetworkAccount::with_allowlist_management` constructor that allowlists that note ([#3330](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3330)).
- Made `AuthNetworkAccount` allowlist management enabled by default: every account now allowlists the standardized `NetworkAccountConfigNote` script root at construction (folded into `with_allowed_notes`), replacing the dedicated `with_allowlist_management` constructor ([#3355](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3355)).


### Changes

- Split `account_id::validate` into `account_id::validate_structure` (version-independent structural checks) and `account_id::validate` (structure and the version check) ([#3188](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3188)).
- [BREAKING] Moved the initial-state account getters (`get_initial_*`) from `miden::protocol::active_account` to `miden::protocol::native_account`. They now always operate on the native account and panic with `ERR_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_NATIVE` when invoked from a foreign procedure invocation (FPI) context ([#2034](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2034)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `AssetId` to `AssetClass`, the identifier that distinguishes assets within a faucet ([#3079](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3079)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `AssetVaultKey` to `AssetId` (and `AssetVaultKeyHash` to `AssetIdHash`), so an asset is identified by an `AssetId` just as accounts and notes are identified by `AccountId` and `NoteId`. The `Asset::vault_key()` accessor is now `Asset::id()` ([#3079](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3079)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced the AggLayer bridge's hard-coded admin/injector/remover account-ID authorization with an RBAC access-control stack (`RoleBasedAccessControl` + `Authority`); `create_bridge_account` now takes `(seed, admin, BridgeRoles)` where `admin` seeds the built-in `ADMIN` role that administers the operational `FAUCET_MNGR` / `GER_INJECTOR` / `GER_REMOVER` roles, `AggLayerBridge` is now a stateless component, and `RoleBasedAccessControl::with_roles` seeds the initial `ADMIN` and operational-role holders at genesis ([#3130](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3130)).
- [BREAKING] Added an optional per-fill `min_fill_step` floor to PSWAP notes: a fill below `min(min_fill_step, min_requested_amount)` is rejected, preventing a swap from being chipped away by dust-minting partial fills. Also fixed the creator ID field order in `PswapNoteStorage` ([#3203](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3203)).
- [BREAKING] Refactored RBAC role administration to be fully role-based, removing the `Ownable2Step` owner as an unconditional super-admin over the role graph. Replaced `RoleBasedAccessControl::empty()` with `RoleBasedAccessControl::new(initial_admin)` / `with_admins(..)` (which seed the `ADMIN` role), and renamed the `ERR_SENDER_NOT_OWNER_OR_ROLE_ADMIN` abort to `ERR_SENDER_NOT_ROLE_ADMIN` ([#3215](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3215)).
- Added a non-zero version check to `account_id::validate_structure` so the zero account ID no longer passes structural validation ([#3216](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3216)).
- [BREAKING] Unified the MINT and BURN note scripts to serve both fungible and non-fungible faucets: the single `mint` / `burn` note now detects the faucet kind by reflection (the `CodeInspection` component's `has_procedure`, which the fungible and non-fungible faucet components now expose) and calls the matching `mint_and_send` / `receive_and_burn`. Removed the `mint_nft` / `burn_nft` note scripts and the `NonFungibleMintNote` / `NonFungibleBurnNote` / `NonFungibleMintNoteStorage` types; `MintNote` / `BurnNote` and `MintNoteStorage` (with fungible and non-fungible variants) now cover both faucet kinds ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3222)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed the `miden::standards::metadata` module to `miden::standards::inspection` (in MASM, the `miden-standards` account components, and the `miden_standards::account::inspection` Rust module), scoping it as the home of `CodeInspection`, the storage schema, and future inspection components ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3222)).
- Added `NonFungibleFaucet::asset_status` API and `AssetStatus` enum (`NotIssued` / `Issued` / `Burned`) for querying a commitment's issuance status from account storage, mirroring the on-chain `get_asset_status` procedure ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3222)).
- Cleaned up `signature.masm` by removing redundant scheme-id validation and duplication, dropping the `neq.0` double-negation in `assert_supported_scheme_word`, and eliminating the unused `NUM_OF_APPROVERS_LOC` slot; also optimized `verify_signatures` to reuse the signer index and approver public key from the operand stack instead of round-tripping them through local memory ([#3230](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3230)).
- Fixed the transaction executor host honoring `AuthRequest` events emitted outside the registered auth procedure, which let untrusted note or transaction scripts force the host to sign; signature production is now restricted to the authentication procedure ([#3233](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3233)).
- Fixed the `AuthRequest` gate introduced in [#3233](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3233) to restrict only signature production ([#3471](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3471)).
- Changed the default `LocalTransactionProver` hash function from `BLAKE3` to `Poseidon2`, added ECDSA variants for every signature-authenticated transaction benchmark, and restructured the time counting benchmark IDs to encode the signing scheme and proving hash function (e.g. `poseidon2/falcon/single-p2id-note`) ([#3152](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3152)).
- `ConstantFeePolicy` now aborts fee estimation for note scripts without a fee schedule entry instead of estimating them to a fee of 0; to make a note script free, schedule an explicit 0 fee for it. Fee schedule entries are stored as `[fee_amount, 0, 0, 1]`, where the last element is a set-marker distinguishing scheduled entries from unset keys ([#3326](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3326)).
- [BREAKING] Added a fee asset ID slot to the `FeeManager` (set via the required `FeeManagerBuilder::fee_faucet_id`, read via the FPI-callable `get_fee_asset_id`); the manager asserts the fee asset returned by the active fee policy matches it, and `collect_sponsored_fees` / `create_network_note_sponsorships` now take the expected fee asset ID as a stack input ([#3347](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3347)).
- [BREAKING] Transaction fees are now paid by the authentication procedure creating a public TX_FEE note before the transaction summary is created, so the fee payment is covered by the signature (`miden::standards::fee`). The payment asset and conversion rate are committed to via the auth args (see `FeeConversionInfo`); on zero-base-fee chains no note is created ([#2899](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/discussions/2899), [#3346](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3346)).
- [BREAKING] Added `timeframe` and `priority` pricing inputs to `estimate_note_fee`; the note's script root and storage commitment are now collapsed into its recipient ([#3349](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3349)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the `Package as Library` alias, so APIs use `Package` directly: `NoteScript::from_library` / `from_library_reference` and `TransactionScript::from_library` / `from_library_reference` now take `&Package`, and `AccountComponentCode::as_library` / `into_library` are now `as_package` / `into_package`. Also removed the `Program`-based constructors `NoteScript::new` and `TransactionScript::new`, and the redundant `NoteScript::from_package` ([#3357](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3357)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `basic_wallet::add_assets_to_account` to `basic_wallet::move_note_assets_to_account`, reflecting that the assets are removed from the active note rather than merely added to the account ([#3343](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3343)).
- [BREAKING] The multisig and singlesig ACL auth components now pay transaction fees via `miden::standards::fee::pay_fee` before the transaction summary is created (the ACL exempt branch pays in the native fee asset) ([#2899](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/discussions/2899)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced the owner-only transfer allowlist/blocklist admin components (`AllowlistOwnerControlled` / `BlocklistOwnerControlled`) with authority-gated `AllowlistManager` / `BlocklistManager` ([#3277](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3277)).
- [BREAKING] Migrated the `miden-agglayer` library, components and note scripts to `miden-project.toml` projects ([#3306](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3306)). 
- [BREAKING] Renamed the BATCH_FEE standard note to TX_FEE: `BatchFeeNote` is now `TxFeeNote`, `miden::standards::notes::batch_fee` is now `miden::standards::notes::tx_fee`, and `StandardNote::BATCH_FEE` is now `StandardNote::TX_FEE`. The `0xFEE` note tag value is unchanged ([#3314](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3314)).
- [BREAKING] Network accounts (`AuthNetworkAccount`) and no-auth accounts (`NoAuth`) now pay the transaction fee in the native fee asset at rate 1/1, funded from the account's vault ([#2899](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/discussions/2899)).

## v0.16.0-alpha.4 (2026-07-16)

### Features

- Added the canonical `ExpirationTransactionScript` to the transaction-script allowlists for AggLayer bridge and faucet accounts, allowing the network transaction builder to bound their transaction expiration.

## v0.16.0-alpha.3 (2026-07-15)

### Fixes

- Fixed `SendNotesTransactionScript` generating a script that returned at an invalid stack depth when a note carried no assets, causing the VM to reject the transaction with `InvalidStackDepthOnReturn` ([#3302](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3302)).

## v0.16.0-alpha.2 (2026-07-13)

### Changes

- [BREAKING] Hardened multisig auth and account code construction: rejected duplicate procedure roots (`AccountCode::from_parts` is now fallible) and duplicate approver public keys, unenforceable procedure threshold overrides, out-of-range `get_signer_at` indices, and foreign roots in `set_procedure_policy` ([#3246](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3246)).
- Added a CI release job that uploads the pre-built `protocol.masp` and `standards.masp` packages to the GitHub release page to aid `midenup`'s installation speed ([#2859](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2859)).
- [BREAKING] Change proving from being `async` to `sync` ([#3281](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3281)).
- `warden::set_warden` and agglayer's `eth_address::to_account_id` now validate only the structure of an account ID (`account_id::validate_structure`) instead of also requiring version = 1 ([#3288](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3288)).

## v0.16.0-alpha.1 (2026-07-12)

### Features

- [BREAKING] Added GER removal mechanism with a dedicated `ger_remover` role, `remove_ger` MASM procedure, `REMOVE_GER` note script, `RemoveGerNote` Rust helper, and a running keccak256 removed-GER hash chain; `AggLayerBridge::new`, `create_bridge_account`, and `create_existing_bridge_account` now take a `ger_remover_id` argument ([#2837](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2837)).
- Added `AccountComponent::has_procedure(root)` helper ([#2974](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2974)).
- Added `active_note::is_public` and `active_note::is_private` MASM procedures for checking whether the active note is public or private ([#2988](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2988)).
- Added a `min_burn_amount` fungible faucet burn policy that rejects burns below a configurable, owner-gated minimum burn amount ([#3021](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3021)).
- Added the `active_account::has_storage_slot` MASM procedure for checking whether a storage slot exists on the active account without panicking ([#3037](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3037)).
- Added the canonical `ExpirationTransactionScript` to `miden-standards`, with a delta-independent script root that network accounts can allowlist ([#3051](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3051)).
- Added `Note::has_attachments` and `NoteMetadata::has_attachments` helpers, and retained private note attachments in `MockChain` ([#3060](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3060)).
- [BREAKING] Migrated the `miden-protocol` library to a `miden-project.toml` project ([#3094](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3094)).
- [BREAKING] Migrated the `miden-standards` library to a `miden-project.toml` project ([#3107](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3107)).
- Added a global emergency switch to `Authority`: owner-gated `freeze` / `unfreeze` procedures toggle an `is_frozen` flag that makes `assert_authorized` block every authority-gated procedure at once, regardless of role or owner membership ([#3102](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3102)).
- [BREAKING] Added the TX_FEE standard note (`TxFeeNote` / `miden::standards::notes::tx_fee`): a public, untargeted P2ID-like note consumable by any account, intended for paying transaction fees to a batch builder. Includes MASM `tx_fee::prepare_note` / `tx_fee::create_output_note` creation procedures, the unique `0xFEE` note tag, and a `StandardNote::TX_FEE` variant ([#3117](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3117)).
- Added a non-fungible (NFT) faucet (`NonFungibleFaucet`): the asset value is an off-chain salted commitment `hash(user_data, salt)`, and an on-chain asset-status registry keyed by `[hash0, hash1, 0, 0]` enforces per-commitment uniqueness and permanent burn. Added `create_user_non_fungible_faucet` / `create_network_non_fungible_faucet` APIs, the `mint_nft` / `burn_nft` note scripts (`NonFungibleMintNote` / `NonFungibleBurnNote`), a `compute_commitment` helper, and reuses `TokenMetadata` (with `external_link` surfaced as `contract_uri`) and `TokenPolicyManager` for mint/burn/transfer policies ([#3106](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3106)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `AccountDelta` from `ExecutedTransaction` which is replaced by `AccountPatch` ([#3109](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3109)).
- Added `ExpirationTransactionScript` to standards package and assemble it at build-time ([#3111](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3111)).
- [BREAKING] Restructured the account storage patch to record create, update, and remove operations per slot ([#3123](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3123)).
- Added a standalone `Warden` account component storing a single warden account ID, with `get_warden` / `set_warden` procedures and `is_sender_warden` / `assert_sender_is_warden` authorization primitives ([#3125](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3125)).
- [BREAKING] Included the storage slot delta operation (create, update, or remove) in the account storage patch commitment ([#3142](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3142)).
- [BREAKING] PSWAP notes now treat the requested asset amount as a minimum rather than an exact cap: a fill at or above it is accepted and takes the whole offered side with no remainder note (fills above the requested amount previously reverted). Partial fills below the minimum are unchanged. The `PswapNoteStorage` accessors `requested_asset` and `requested_asset_amount` were renamed to `min_requested_asset` and `min_requested_amount` (`requested_faucet_id` is unchanged), and the `ERR_PSWAP_FILL_EXCEEDS_REQUESTED` error was removed ([#3148](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3148)).
- Updated `AuthRequest` event to carry either signature or TX summary, but not both enabling signature verification on arbitrary messages ([#3157](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3157)).
- Added the `CodeInspection` standard account component, exposing the `has_procedure`, `get_code_commitment`, `get_num_procedures`, and `get_procedure_root` introspection procedures on an account's public interface ([#3162](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3162)).
- Added the `account_id::eqz` MASM helper to check whether an account ID is zero ([#3170](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3170)).
- Introduced `MockTransactionBuilder`, created via `MockChain::build_transaction` ([#3172](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3172)).
- [BREAKING] Added `@account_procedure` attribute to mark which procedures should be included in the account component interface ([#3171](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3171)).
- [BREAKING] Added `@transaction_script` attribute to mark the script entrypoint. Migrated transaction scripts assembly to `Library` ([#3173](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3173)).
- [BREAKING] Updated `BlockHeader` to support multiple validator keys and added `ValidatorKeys` and `BlockSignatures` types ([#3174](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3174)).
- Added the `miden::protocol::tx::compute_fee` procedure, which lets account and note code compute the transaction fee during execution ([#3211](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3211)).
- Added type signatures to the public `miden::protocol` library procedures, using semantic type aliases (e.g. `AccountId`, `AssetId`, `StorageSlotId`, `AccountProcedureRoot`) that mirror the Rust API ([#3234](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3234)).
- Added the `OwnerActionNote` (`OwnerAction`) for triggering `Ownable2Step` management actions (transfer / accept / renounce ownership) on an account via a note ([#3245](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3245)).
- Added the `RbacActionNote` (`RbacAction`) for triggering `RoleBasedAccessControl` management actions (grant / revoke role, set role admin, renounce role) on an account via a note. A selector in the note storage dispatches to the matching component procedure, which authorizes against the note sender ([#3248](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3248)).
- Added the `PauseActionNote` (`PauseAction`) for triggering `PausableManager` admin actions (pause / unpause) on an account via a note. A selector in the note storage dispatches to the matching component procedure, which authorizes the note sender through the account-wide `Authority` component ([#3258](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3258)).
- Added the `FaucetPolicyActionNote` (`FaucetPolicyAction`) for switching a faucet's active `TokenPolicyManager` policy (mint / burn / send / receive) to an allowed alternative via a note. A selector in the note storage dispatches to the matching `set_*_policy` procedure, which authorizes the note sender through the account-wide `Authority` component ([#3260](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3260)).
- Added a skeleton batch kernel ([#1122](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/1122)) wired through `LocalBatchProver::prove` and attached to `ProvenBatch` as an `ExecutionProof`. It does not yet perform any verification.

### Changes

- [BREAKING] Replaced the `P2idNote` marker type and its `P2idNote::create` factory with a `P2idNote` struct built via a `bon` typestate builder (`P2idNote::builder()`). P2ID notes must now carry at least one asset; a `P2idNote` converts into a `Note` via `Note::from`, and the builder offers `.asset()`/`.assets()`, `.attachment()`/`.attachments()`, and `.generate_serial_number()` ([#2283](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2283)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced the `MintNote` marker type and its `MintNote::create` factory with a struct built via a `bon` typestate builder (`MintNote::builder()`); a `MintNote` converts into a `Note` via `Note::from` ([#2283](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2283)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced the `BurnNote` marker type and its `BurnNote::create` factory with a struct built via a `bon` typestate builder (`BurnNote::builder()`); a `BurnNote` converts into a `Note` via `Note::from` ([#2283](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2283)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced the `P2ideNote` marker type and its `P2ideNote::create` factory with a `P2ideNote` struct built via a `bon` typestate builder (`P2ideNote::builder()`). P2IDE notes must now carry at least one asset; the optional `reclaim_height`/`timelock_height` are set via the builder, `P2ideNoteStorage::into_recipient` is now infallible, and a `P2ideNote` converts into a `Note` via `Note::from` ([#2283](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2283)).
- [BREAKING] Reworked `NoteFile` variants into `NoteId`, `ExpectedNote`, and `Committed`, added `NoteSyncHint` carrying a required `NoteTag`, and moved `NoteFile` and `NoteSyncHint` from `miden-protocol` to `miden-standards` ([#1983](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/1983)).
- [BREAKING] Refactored `TransferPolicy`, `MintPolicyConfig`, and `BurnPolicyConfig` from enums into structs ([#2974](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2974)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `AuthMethod` enum, `AccountAuthComponent` / `AccountAuthScheme`, and the `AccessControl::AuthControlled` variant. Faucet and wallet factories now take concrete auth-component types so invalid configurations are rejected at compile time ([#2944](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2944)).
- [BREAKING] Split `create_fungible_faucet` into `create_user_fungible_faucet(auth_component: AuthSingleSigAcl, ...)` (installs `Authority::AuthControlled` directly) and the opinionated `create_network_fungible_faucet(access_control, ...)` (always `AccountType::Public`, builds the `AuthNetworkAccount` allowlist internally from `MintNote` + `BurnNote` script roots with an empty tx-script allowlist). Other auth schemes / shapes are no longer supported through these helpers — fall back to `AccountBuilder` directly. A `user_faucet_single_sig_acl` testing helper is provided behind the `testing` feature ([#2944](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2944)).
- Added `create_multisig_wallet` and `create_guarded_wallet` helpers for `BasicWallet` accounts authenticated by `AuthMultisig` and `AuthGuardedMultisig` respectively ([#2944](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2944)).
- [BREAKING] `create_basic_wallet` now takes `AuthSingleSig` directly and returns `AccountError` instead of the removed `BasicWalletError` ([#2944](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2944)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `AccountInterface::auth()` and `AccountComponentInterface::auth_scheme()`. Auth components are now discovered via `AccountInterface::auth_components()`, which iterates `AccountComponentInterface` variants flagged by `is_auth_component()` ([#2944](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2944)).
- [BREAKING] `FungibleFaucet` no longer installs the `is_paused` storage slot itself. Faucet factories (`create_user_fungible_faucet` / `create_network_fungible_faucet`) now bundle the `Pausable` component (slot + `is_paused()` view procedure) alongside `PausableManager`. Callers using `AccountBuilder` directly must also install `Pausable` or the faucet's mint / burn / transfer / metadata-setter procedures will panic at runtime ([#2944](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2944)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced the per-tree account and nullifier backend traits with shared `SmtBackend` and `SmtBackendReader` traits, split into read-only and read-write capabilities, enabling read-only `LargeSmt`-backed tree views via `reader()` ([#2755](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2755), [#3009](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3009)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed the `miden-tx-batch-prover` crate to `miden-tx-batch` ([#3035](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3035)).
- [BREAKING] Unified the fungible and non-fungible asset vault deltas into a single asset delta, changing the on-chain account delta commitment layout ([#3038](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3038)).
- [BREAKING] Migrated `SendNotesTransactionScript` from run-time script generation to static MASM scripts assembled at build time. Callers must now pass `tx_script_args()` as the transaction script argument and extend the transaction's advice map with `advice_entries()` ([#3250](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3250)).
- Optimized protocol MASM stack-cleaning sequences, saving 1 cycle per occurrence across 9 single-element-extraction procedures ([#3041](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3041)).
- [BREAKING] Refactored `TokenPolicyManager` by adding `invoke_send_policy` / `invoke_receive_policy` wrappers (stored in the protocol reserved asset callback slots) that read the active policy root from the new `active_send_policy_proc_root` / `active_receive_policy_proc_root` storage slots ([#3047](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3047)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced `AccountInterface::build_send_notes_script` with a standalone `SendNotesTransactionScript` built against `AccountCodeInterface` ([#3055](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3055)).
- [BREAKING] Flipped `AuthSingleSigAcl` ACL to an exempt list: every called procedure now requires a signature unless its root is in `exempt_procedures` [#3065](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3065).
- Introduced `AccountPatch` and `AccountVaultPatch` ([#3010](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3010), [#3071](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3071)).
- [BREAKING] Extended `Authority::RbacControlled` to assign roles per authority-gated procedure ([#3072](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3072)).
- [BREAKING] Changed `asset_vault::peek_asset` to accept a pre-hashed `ASSET_KEY_HASH` instead of a raw `ASSET_KEY`; fungible add/remove now hash the vault key once internally, eliminating a redundant `poseidon2::hash` per operation ([#3073](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3073)).
- Refactor `asset_vault::remove_asset` and `faucet::burn` to use a unified path for all asset types, in preparation of custom assets ([#3078](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3078)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed the `TransactionEvent::AuthRequest` field from `pub_key_hash: Word` to `pub_key_commitment: PublicKeyCommitment` ([#3080](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3080)).
- [BREAKING] Tightened `AccountStorage::get_map_item` to take a `StorageMapKey` instead of a raw `Word` ([#3080](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3080)).
- Added an `AccountCode::interface` helper that returns the public `AccountCodeInterface` ([#3080](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3080)).
- Added `AccountPatch::merge` for combining patches across consecutive transactions ([#3082](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3082)).
- Simplified the Ownable2Step owner-check API: merged the owner assertion into a single `exec` `assert_sender_is_owner` and renamed `is_sender_owner_internal` to `is_sender_owner` ([#3088](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3088)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced the account delta in `AccountUpdateDetails`, `TxAccountUpdate`, and the kernel-emitted account update commitment with the account patch ([#3089](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3089)).
- Optimized `rbac::grant_role_internal` and `rbac::revoke_role_internal` by removing the redundant membership read and rearranging the stack ([#3090](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3090)).
- [BREAKING] Split `create_basic_wallet` into `create_basic_wallet` (single-sig), `create_multisig_wallet`, and `create_guarded_wallet`, and rejected per-procedure thresholds below the default on private multisig wallets to prevent a sub-quorum from advancing and withholding private account state ([#3098](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3098)).
- [BREAKING] Introduced the `Approver` and `ApproverSet` types to encapsulate the `(PublicKeyCommitment, AuthScheme)` pair and the `(threshold, approvers)` set, and used them across `AuthSingleSig`, `AuthSingleSigAcl`, `GuardianConfig`, the multisig auth configs, and the wallet constructors ([#3098](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3098)).
- [BREAKING] Refactored the mint policy interface so it is shared across fungible and non-fungible faucets: `policy_manager::execute_mint_policy` (and the mint policy `check_policy` predicates) now operate on the full `ASSET_VALUE` word instead of an `amount` ([#3106](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3106)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the automatic fee computation and removal from the transaction kernel ([#3108](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3108)).
- [BREAKING] Removed `Account::apply_delta` and `AccountDelta::merge` ([#3110](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3110)).
- [BREAKING] Made the RBAC role guard `rbac::assert_sender_has_role` an `exec` procedure and removed it from the `RoleBasedAccessControl` component re-exports ([#3116](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3116)).
- Added a validation inside `set_max_supply` rejects a new cap above `FUNGIBLE_ASSET_MAX_AMOUNT`, keeping the stored cap consistent with the bound enforced at mint time ([#3118](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3118)).
- Refactored `is_max_supply_mutable_internal` in the fungible faucet to read the mutability config through the `get_mutability_config_word` getter instead of accessing the storage slot directly ([#3120](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3120)).
- Added a zero-root check before dispatching the active mint and burn policy in `TokenPolicyManager`, failing with a descriptive error ([#3121](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3121)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `create_user_fungible_faucet` to `create_singlesig_user_fungible_faucet` and added the `create_multisig_user_fungible_faucet(auth_component: AuthMultisig, ...)` and `create_guarded_user_fungible_faucet(auth_component: AuthGuardedMultisig, ...)`. `create_network_fungible_faucet` now allowlists the canonical `ExpirationTransactionScript` in its tx-script allowlist ([#3143](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3143)).
- [BREAKING] Require that full state account deltas/patches contain only `Create` storage slot patches and never `Update` or `Remove` ([#3144](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3144)).
- Changed the default `LocalTransactionProver` hash function from `BLAKE3` to `Poseidon2`, added ECDSA variants for every signature-authenticated transaction benchmark, and restructured the time counting benchmark IDs to encode the signing scheme and proving hash function (e.g. `poseidon2/falcon/single-p2id-note`) ([#3152](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3152)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `AccountStorageDelta` to `AccountStoragePatch` ([#3002](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3002), [#3154](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3154)).
- [BREAKING] Moved asset callback flag from asset vault key to account ID, making it immutable ([#3167](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3167)).
- Documented that the `ecdsa_k256_keccak` authentication scheme discloses the signer's public key and signature at proving time via precompile calldata ([#3178](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3178)).
- [BREAKING] Removed the redundant `all_authority_gated_setter_roots` helper and the per-procedure threshold wiring it in `user_faucet_multisig` / `user_faucet_guarded`, and corrected the fungible and non-fungible faucet factory documents to describe `AuthSingleSigAcl`'s exempt-list ([#3180](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3180)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `AssetId` to `AssetClass`, the identifier that distinguishes assets within a faucet ([#3186](hhttps://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3186)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `AssetVaultKey` to `AssetId` (and `AssetVaultKeyHash` to `AssetIdHash`), so an asset is identified by an `AssetId` just as accounts and notes are identified by `AccountId` and `NoteId`. The `Asset::vault_key()` accessor is now `Asset::id()` ([#3186](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3186)).
- Split `account_id::validate` into `account_id::validate_structure` (version-independent structural checks) and `account_id::validate` (structure and the version check) ([#3188](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3188)).
- [BREAKING] Restricted `output_note::create` and account read/update kernel procedures to only be invoked from the active account's own procedures, requiring standard note scripts (`p2id`, `swap`, `pswap`) and wallets to create notes via `basic_wallet::create_note` ([#3204](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3204)).
- Unified procedure ordering and document sender-based access control's authentication assumption in the `ownable2step` and `rbac` access control modules ([#3205](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3205)).
- Renamed the `Authority` config value slot, expressed the authority kind as a MASM `enum Authority : u8`, and enforced the canonical config-word encoding on read ([#3209](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3209)).
- Optimized the multisig auth component MASM (unconditional loop entry where the counter is guaranteed non-zero, single-step `scheme_id` extraction in `get_signer_at`, and a stack read instead of a local reload in `update_signers_and_threshold`), and documented that growing the signer set does not re-scale existing per-procedure threshold overrides ([#3211](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3211)).
- [BREAKING] Refactored RBAC role administration to be fully role-based, removing the `Ownable2Step` owner as an unconditional super-admin over the role graph. Replaced `RoleBasedAccessControl::empty()` with `RoleBasedAccessControl::new(initial_admin)` / `with_admins(..)` (which seed the `ADMIN` role), and renamed the `ERR_SENDER_NOT_OWNER_OR_ROLE_ADMIN` abort to `ERR_SENDER_NOT_ROLE_ADMIN` ([#3215](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3215)).
- Added a non-zero version check to `account_id::validate_structure` so the zero account ID no longer passes structural validation ([#3216](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3216)).
- Refactor `asset_vault::add_asset` and `faucet::mint` to use a unified path for all asset types, in preparation of custom asset ([#3217](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3217)).
- [BREAKING] Moved the initial-state account getters (`get_initial_*`) from `miden::protocol::active_account` to `miden::protocol::native_account`. They now always operate on the native account and panic with `ERR_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_NATIVE` when invoked from a foreign procedure invocation (FPI) context ([#3218](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3218)).
- [BREAKING] Unified the MINT and BURN note scripts to serve both fungible and non-fungible faucets: the single `mint` / `burn` note now detects the faucet kind by reflection (the `CodeInspection` component's `has_procedure`, which the fungible and non-fungible faucet components now expose) and calls the matching `mint_and_send` / `receive_and_burn`. Removed the `mint_nft` / `burn_nft` note scripts and the `NonFungibleMintNote` / `NonFungibleBurnNote` / `NonFungibleMintNoteStorage` types; `MintNote` / `BurnNote` and `MintNoteStorage` (with fungible and non-fungible variants) now cover both faucet kinds ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3222)).
- Added `NonFungibleFaucet::asset_status` API and `AssetStatus` enum (`NotIssued` / `Issued` / `Burned`) for querying a commitment's issuance status from account storage, mirroring the on-chain `get_asset_status` procedure ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3222)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed the `miden::standards::metadata` module to `miden::standards::inspection` (in MASM, the `miden-standards` account components, and the `miden_standards::account::inspection` Rust module), scoping it as the home of `CodeInspection`, the storage schema, and future inspection components ([#3222](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3222)).
- Cleaned up `signature.masm` by removing redundant scheme-id validation and duplication, dropping the `neq.0` double-negation in `assert_supported_scheme_word`, and eliminating the unused `NUM_OF_APPROVERS_LOC` slot; also optimized `verify_signatures` to reuse the signer index and approver public key from the operand stack instead of round-tripping them through local memory ([#3230](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3230)).
- [BREAKING] P2IDE now reclaims against a `reclaimer` stored in note storage (builder-settable, defaults to `sender`) ([#3239](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3239)).
- [BREAKING] Moved the following fungible asset procedures out of the protocol layer into the new `miden::standards::assets::fungible_asset` module ([#3255](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3255)).
  - Moved `protocol::asset::create_fungible_id` -> `create_id`
  - Moved `protocol::asset::create_fungible_asset` -> `create`
  - Moved `protocol::active_account::get_balance` -> `get_active_account_balance`
  - Moved `protocol::native_account::get_initial_balance` -> `get_initial_native_account_balance`
  - Moved `protocol::asset::fungible_to_amount` -> `to_amount`
- [BREAKING] Moved the non-fungible asset procedures out of the protocol layer into the new `miden::standards::assets::non_fungible_asset` module ([#3255](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3255)).
  - Moved `protocol::asset::create_non_fungible_asset` -> `create`
  - Moved `protocol::asset::non_fungible_value_into_asset_class` -> `value_into_asset_class`
- [BREAKING] Removed the faucet-relative `create` variants (`protocol::faucet::{create_fungible_asset, create_non_fungible_asset}`); callers now push the faucet ID via `active_account::get_id` and call `{fungible_asset, non_fungible_asset}::create` ([#3255](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3255)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed and generalized `miden::protocol::active_account::has_non_fungible_asset` to `has_asset`, which now accepts any asset ID instead of only non-fungible assets ([#3255](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3255)).
- Added `miden::protocol::native_account::has_initial_asset` procedure returning whether the native account's vault contained an asset at the beginning of the transaction ([#3255](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3255)).
- Added a stub for the `miden::protocol::native_account::upgrade` kernel procedure ([#3256](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3256)).
- [BREAKING] Made input note assets stateful: assets can now be removed from input notes during transaction execution ([#3272](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/3272)).
  - Replaced the `active_note::get_assets` / `input_note::get_assets` and `input_note::get_assets_info` procedures with `remove_all_assets`, `get_initial_assets` and `get_initial_assets_info`, and added `get_initial_num_assets`, `get_asset` and `remove_asset`.
- [BREAKING] Updated `miden-vm` dependencies to v0.25, Miden crypto dependencies to v0.28, and the MSRV to 1.96.1 ([#3278](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3278)).
- Added the `OwnerActionNote` (`OwnerAction`) for triggering `Ownable2Step` management actions (transfer / accept / renounce ownership) on an account via a note ([#3245](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3245)).
- Added the `RbacActionNote` (`RbacAction`) for triggering `RoleBasedAccessControl` management actions (grant / revoke role, set role admin, renounce role) on an account via a note. A selector in the note storage dispatches to the matching component procedure, which authorizes against the note sender ([#3248](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3248)).
- Updated `miden-vm` dependencies to v0.25 ([#3278](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3278)).

### Fixes

- Fixed `update_ger` to explicitly reject duplicate GER insertions with `ERR_GER_ALREADY_REGISTERED` instead of silently accepting them ([#2983](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2983)).
- AggLayer `bridge_out` now rejects B2AGG notes whose `NoteType` is not `Public`, preventing a recipient-identical private note from desyncing the Local Exit Tree from AggLayer's off-chain mirror ([#2988](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2988)).
- [BREAKING] Block validator signatures are now verified against the validator key committed to by the parent block, enabling safe validator key rotation. `BlockHeader::validator_key` now denotes the signer of the *next* block, `ProvenBlock`/`SignedBlock` `new` no longer verify the signature (pass the parent header to `validate` to authenticate a block against its parent's validator key), and `ProposedBlock` serialization gained a trailing `next_validator_key` field ([#3030](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3030)).
- Fixed `pausable::assert_not_paused` to guard its storage read with `active_account::has_storage_slot`, making it a no-op on accounts without the `Pausable` component instead of panicking on the missing `is_paused` slot ([#3047](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3047)).
- [BREAKING] Fixed batch ID being serialized/deserialized and potentially not matching the serialized transaction headers ([#3061](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3061)).
- Fixed the `TokenPolicyManager` `get_mint_policy` / `get_burn_policy` / `get_send_policy` / `get_receive_policy` getters to align the 16-felt `call` ABI. ([#3114](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3114)).
- Fixed misleading documentation in the faucet and transfer policy procedures ([#3119](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3119)).
- Simplified the `ownable2step` ownership transitions ([#3170](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3170)).
- Fixed `note_script_allowlist::assert_all_input_notes_allowed` and `tx_script_allowlist::assert_tx_script_allowed` to read the allowlist from the transaction's initial storage state via `active_account::get_initial_map_item` ([#3182](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3182)).
- Fixed `set_procedure_threshold` now asserts `PROC_ROOT` is one of the account's procedures (`ERR_PROC_ROOT_NOT_IN_ACCOUNT`) before storing an override, and corrected the inaccurate `assert_new_tx`, `update_signers_and_threshold`, and `get_signer_at` stack-layout and advice-map comments ([#3211](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3211)).
- Fixed the transaction executor host honoring `AuthRequest` events emitted outside the registered auth procedure, which let untrusted note or transaction scripts force the host to sign; signature production is now restricted to the authentication procedure ([#3233](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3233)).
- Fixed `eth_address::to_account_id` to validate the decoded `AccountId` structural invariants, preventing a malformed bridge-in destination address from being routed into an unspendable P2ID/MINT output ([#3243](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3243)).
- Added an enforcement for `TransactionEventId::is_privileged` in the host, rejecting any privileged event emitted outside the root context ([#3251](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3251)).

### Enhancements

- Added a CI release job that uploads the pre-built `protocol.masp` and `standards.masp` packages to the GitHub release page to aid `midenup`'s installation speed ([#2859](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2859)).

## v0.15.3 (2026-06-10)

- [BREAKING] Changed AggLayerBridge to store its AggLayer network ID in account storage ([#3062](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3062)).

## v0.15.2 (2026-06-05)

- [BREAKING] `AuthNetworkAccount` now gates transaction scripts with a root allowlist instead of banning them outright, enabling network accounts to run approved tx scripts such as setting the expiration delta ([#3028](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3028)).
- [BREAKING] `TransactionScript::root()` now returns `TransactionScriptRoot` instead of `Word` ([#3028](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3028)).
- Renamed `AuthNetworkAccount::with_allowlist` to `with_allowed_notes` and aligned the component's internal allowlist field names, for consistency with `with_allowed_tx_scripts` ([#3049](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/3049)).

## v0.15.1 (2026-05-31)

- Reject batches and blocks where an unauthenticated note is consumed before it is created to prevent circular note dependencies ([#2993](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2993)).

## v0.15.0 (2026-05-22)

### Features

- Added a `FungibleTokenMetadata` component supporting name, description, logo URI, and external links, along with MASM procedures for retrieving token metadata (get_token_metadata, get_max_supply, get_decimals, get_token_symbol). Also aligned fungible faucet token metadata with the standard by using the canonical storage slot, enabling compatibility with MASM metadata getters ([#2439](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-base/pull/2439)).
- Added `PSWAP` (partial swap) note for decentralized partial-fill asset exchange with remainder note re-creation ([#2636](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2636)).
- [BREAKING] Renamed `NoteId` to `NoteDetailsCommitment`, new `NoteId` struct now includes the NoteMetadata ([#1731](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/1731)).
- Added lock/unlock path for Miden-native tokens in the AggLayer bridge: `is_native` flag in `faucet_registry_map`, bridge-local `faucet_metadata_map` (replacing FPI to faucets for conversion data), and `lock_asset` / `unlock_and_send` procedures so the bridge holds native assets in its own vault instead of burn/mint via a faucet ([#2771](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2771)).
- [BREAKING] Added support for multiple attachments per note ([#2795](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2795), [#2849](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2849)):
- [BREAKING] Removed `AccountStorageMode::Network`; network accounts are now identified via `NetworkAccountNoteAllowlist` ([#2900](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2900)).
- Added `PswapAttachment` scheme and `PswapNote::payback_note` / `remainder_note` discovery helpers so creators can reconstruct private paybacks from on-chain commitments ([#2909](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2909)).
- Added benchmark for ECDSA signed transaction ([#2967](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2967)).
- [agglayer] Added faucet deregistration, letting the bridge admin revoke a registered faucet ([#2838](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2838)).

- Added `AssetAmount` wrapper type for validated fungible asset amounts ([#2721](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2721)).
- Added validation of leaf type on CLAIM note processing to prevent message leaves from being processed as asset claims ([#2730](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2730)).
- [BREAKING] Removed redundant outputs from kernel procedures: `note::write_assets_to_memory`, `active_note::get_assets`, `input_note::get_assets`, `output_note::get_assets`, `active_note::get_storage`, and `faucet::mint` no longer return values identical to their inputs ([#2733](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2733)).
- Added `metadata_into_note_type` procedure to `note.masm` for extracting note type from metadata header ([#2738](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2738)).
- [BREAKING] Reduced `MAX_ASSETS_PER_NOTE` from 255 to 64 and `NOTE_MEM_SIZE` from 3072 to 1024 ([#2741](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2741)).
- [BREAKING] Stored `origin_network` in LE-packed format in AggLayer faucet storage ([#2745](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2745)).
- Optimized `B2AGG` processing with selective load/save of Local Exit Tree frontier entries, halving frontier storage map syscalls ([#2752](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2752)).

- Made deserialization of `AccountCode` more robust ([#2788](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2788)).
- [BREAKING] Replaced `NoAuth` with the new `AuthNetworkAccount` auth component on the AggLayer bridge and AggLayer faucet, closing the forged-MINT attack surface where any transaction against the bridge could emit a bridge-authored MINT note ([#2797](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2797), [#2818](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2818)).
- Renamed the AggLayer faucet registry flag constant for clarity ([#2812](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/issues/2812)).
- Fixed `output_note::add_asset` and `output_note::set_attachment` to no longer accept invalid note indices ([#2824](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2824)).
- [BREAKING] Keyed the AggLayer faucet token registry by `(origin_token_address, origin_network)` instead of `origin_token_address` alone, preventing same-address cross-network mint collisions on CLAIM ([#2860](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2860)).
- Validated `PartialBlockchain` invariants on deserialization ([#2888](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2888)).

- Fixed `TokenPolicyManager::manager_storage_slots` to register the protocol-reserved asset-callback storage slots whenever any transfer policy is configured (including `TransferAllowAll`), so every minted asset carries `AssetCallbackFlag::Enabled` and future `set_send_policy` / `set_receive_policy` switches apply uniformly to the entire circulating supply ([#2946](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2946)).
- Fixed `create_fungible_faucet` leaving authority-gated setters unauthenticated under `AccessControl::AuthControlled`: the `AuthSingleSigAcl` trigger list now contains every authority-gated setter root (`set_max_supply`, `set_description`, `set_logo_uri`, `set_external_link`, `set_mint_policy`, `set_burn_policy`, `set_send_policy`, `set_receive_policy`) in addition to `mint_and_send`.

- [BREAKING] Updated for compatibility with miden-vm v0.22.1 (`Arc<Library>` return types, `MastArtifact`/`PackageKind` removal) ([#2742](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2742)).

## 0.14.2 (2026-03-31)

- Changed felt-to-word layout in the type registry from `[0, 0, 0, felt]` to `[felt, 0, 0, 0]` to match the actual MASM storage layout ([#2711](https://github.com/0xMiden/protocol/pull/2711)).
